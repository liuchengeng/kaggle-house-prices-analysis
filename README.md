# kaggle-house-prices-analysis

## Problem
Predict house sale prices from structured features in the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

## Approach
Start with exploratory analysis and a simple baseline model, then iterate on feature engineering, model selection, and validation.

## Repo Structure
- `data/`: raw and processed datasets (not tracked)
- `notebooks/`: exploratory and experimentation notebooks
- `src/`: reusable code for data, features, models, metrics, and explainability
- `scripts/`: command-line helpers for training or evaluation
- `reports/figures/`: generated charts and figures

## Reproducibility
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, keep raw data in `data/raw`, and run scripts or notebooks to reproduce results.

## Results
Summarize model performance and key findings here.
